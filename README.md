# Linear Regression using Keras

This project demonstrates how to perform **linear regression** using a simple deep learning model built with **Keras** (a high-level API of TensorFlow). Linear regression is one of the fundamental techniques in supervised learning, where the goal is to predict a **continuous numerical value** based on one or more input features.

## 🧠 Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can **learn a linear relationship** between input features and a continuous target variable. Unlike traditional linear regression from libraries like scikit-learn, this project uses a neural network with a linear output layer, leveraging the Keras framework.

## 📊 Dataset

In this notebook, a linear regression model is used to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles.In a regression problem, the aim is to predict the output of a continuous value like a price or a height or a weight, etcThe dataset used in this project is a simple synthetic or real-world structured dataset containing:

- **Independent variables (features)**: Numerical inputs such as age, income, experience, etc.
- **Dependent variable (target)**: A continuous value such as salary, house price, or cost.
- **Dataset Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset
  
> 📌 **Note**: This setup is generic and can be adapted to any regression dataset.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The neural network model in this project is very simple:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts input features.
- **Dense Layer**: Single neuron with a linear activation (`activation='linear'`).
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), suitable for regression tasks.
- **Optimizer**: Adam, a commonly used optimization algorithm.

## 📈 Results & Visualization

The model is trained on input data to learn the best fit line that minimizes the MSE between predicted and actual target values. Results typically include:

- Training loss vs. epochs plot
- Predicted vs. actual values plot

These visualizations help to understand how well the model generalizes.
